## About us

Many young people play video games, but concerns about their impact on stress and mental health exist. Encouraging mindful game choices, awareness, and support for mental health is essential, and ongoing research can help guide responsible gaming habits.

## Our Solution

We invite psychologists, elementary school teachers, and game lovers to join our team, and interview gamers to explore effective game mechanics that combine learning with enjoyment, to bring positive change to the gaming community.

## To make difference

There are very few developers working on games mixing entertainment with education. And we found it’s a great opportunity to work on them in Ireland.
